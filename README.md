About Barry

This is my Sinatra project for Flatiron School's Immersive Software Engineering program in which I am enrolled. It is also the beginning of a lifelong mission to revolutionize the way news is collected, created, and delivered through the responsible use of cognitive technologies.

I call this application Barry, which will become an artificial intelligence extended by a global network of AI journalists capable of producing 100% accurate, unbiased, and balanced news accessible to all people regardless of location, language, or literacy.
